## Habit & Routine Trends

### Day-of-Week Insights

#### Weekly Success Matrix
- Render a compact grid per habit where **rows represent sequential weeks** (most recent first by default) and **columns map to Monday–Sunday**.
- Cell states show the **completion rate for that habit on the given day** using color intensity (e.g., low saturation for 0–25%, medium for 26–75%, high for 76–100%). Include accessible text labels for exact percentages.
- Provide quick filters to toggle between **habit types, date ranges, and rolling time windows** (last 4, 8, or 12 weeks) so users can spot pattern shifts.
- Allow users to **hover or tap a cell to reveal supporting context**: number of attempts, completions, and any linked notes or reflections for that day.

#### Actionable Tips
- Surface inline annotations beneath the matrix such as “**Mondays trend 20% lower than other days**—consider scheduling a lighter variation.”
- Generate recommendations from the last 3–4 weeks of data, prioritizing **days with sustained underperformance or breakout success**.
- Pair each tip with a suggested action (e.g., “Move your reading block to Tuesday/Thursday evenings” or “Send a reminder at 8 AM on Fridays”).
- Let users **acknowledge or snooze tips** so the system can learn which guidance resonates and reduce repeated messaging.
