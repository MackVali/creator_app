# Schedule Top Navigation Improvements Plan

## Objectives
- Make the schedule page's top navigation visually "solid" and cohesive with the rest of the interface.
- Ensure the navigation remains visible by following the user as they scroll (sticky behavior) without obstructing content.

## Assumptions & Context
- The schedule page likely lives under `src/app/(dashboard)/schedule` with related UI components in `src/components/schedule/`.
- The top navigation currently feels lightweight (e.g., translucent background, minimal separation, or lack of affordances) and scrolls away with the content.
- The page already uses Tailwind CSS and Next.js; we will follow existing design tokens (colors, spacing, shadows) for consistency.

## Research & Discovery
1. **Audit existing markup and styles**
   - Identify the component that renders the top navigation (probable candidates include `ScheduleSearchSheet`, `ScheduleToolbar`, or layout files).
   - Note its current structure (flex layout, buttons, search, filters) and class names.
   - Check for existing sticky helpers or layout wrappers that might interfere with sticky positioning.
2. **Review design guidelines**
   - Confirm color palette, border radii, spacing scale, and shadow utilities used elsewhere in the app to keep the navigation consistent.
   - Look for other sticky headers in the product for reference.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Refine container structure**
   - Wrap the top navigation content in a dedicated container (e.g., `<header>` or `<div className="schedule-topnav">`).
   - Ensure the container sits within the layout that controls horizontal padding so it aligns with the main schedule grid.
2. **Apply solid visual treatment**
   - Add background color (`bg-surface` or equivalent neutral from Tailwind config).
   - Introduce a subtle border or shadow (`shadow-sm`/`shadow-md`, `border-b`) to create separation from the scrolling content.
   - Enforce consistent spacing using Tailwind spacing tokens (`px-6`, `py-4` etc.).
   - Harmonize typography (font weight/size) with other navigation elements.
3. **Enable sticky behavior**
   - Apply `sticky top-0 z-XX` to the navigation container so it remains visible while scrolling.
   - If the page has surrounding scroll containers, ensure sticky is applied relative to the correct element (may require moving the header outside of nested scrollable divs).
   - Add a backdrop blur or solid color to prevent underlying content from showing through when scrolled.
4. **Handle responsive states**
   - Verify sticky header on mobile and tablet breakpoints; adjust padding or layout to accommodate smaller screens.
   - Ensure interactive elements (search, filters, buttons) retain appropriate hit areas.
5. **Adjust page layout spacing**
   - Add top padding/margin to the main schedule content so the sticky header does not overlap when anchored.
   - Confirm that modals or dropdowns inside the header have appropriate z-index relative to other components.

## Testing & QA
- Test across browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) to confirm sticky behavior.
- Scroll through long schedules to ensure header remains visible and does not jitter.
- Check keyboard navigation and screen reader labeling for accessibility.
- Validate that the header doesn't cause layout shift when toggling filters or view modes.

## Follow-up Considerations
- If the header hosts dynamic controls (filters, date pickers), consider adding loading or disabled states that align with the new visuals.
- Document the chosen utility classes or create a reusable component if other pages need similar sticky navigation.
