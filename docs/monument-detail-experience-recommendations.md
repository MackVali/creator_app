# Monument Detail Experience Recommendations

## 1. Clarify Progress at a Glance
- **Construction status header**: Replace the static title block with a progress-integrated hero that combines monument name, current charge %, and remaining milestones so users immediately see where they stand.
- **Phase roadmap**: Introduce a horizontal stepper that outlines foundational, build-out, and polish phases; highlight the active stage to communicate momentum and upcoming focus areas.

## 2. Reframe Goals as Build Tasks
- **Task categorization**: Group goals into structural categories (e.g., "Foundation", "Systems", "Finishing") with color-coded badges to reinforce how each contributes to the monument.
- **Completion impact**: Display the charge gain or structural unlock associated with each goal so completing one feels like adding a tangible piece to the build.

## 3. Energize Activity & Notes
- **Build log timeline**: Surface recent goal completions, XP boosts, and key notes as a chronological construction log with clear timestamps and author context.
- **Pinned insights**: Allow pinning high-signal notes (blueprints, inspection findings) to the top of the panel, giving builders quick access to critical guidance.

## 4. Showcase Rewards & Unlocks
- **Reward spotlight**: Add a card that previews the capabilities, perks, or rituals that unlock when the monument is fully charged, reinforcing why progress matters.
- **Dependency map**: Visualize linked monuments or rituals that benefit from this build, helping users understand the broader ecosystem they are constructing.

## 5. Reduce Friction in Daily Use
- **Inline quick actions**: Provide contextual buttons (e.g., "Add goal", "Log note", "Charge ritual") directly within each section so users don’t need to hunt for entry points.
- **Smart defaults & prompts**: Nudge users with suggested next steps—such as recommending a goal to complete today or a ritual to recharge—based on current progress gaps.

## 6. Celebrate Milestones
- **Phase change celebrations**: Trigger lightweight animations or banners when a phase completes to reinforce progress and delight users.
- **Personalized recap emails**: Offer optional weekly summaries highlighting XP gained, goals completed, and new unlocks to extend the sense of accomplishment beyond the app.

## 7. Prepare for Future Extensions
- **Component library alignment**: Ensure new UI elements use the design system components so future iterations (e.g., mobile responsiveness, theming) remain consistent.
- **Analytics instrumentation**: Plan to track interaction rates with new elements (timeline expansion, quick actions) to validate whether the refreshed experience drives engagement.
